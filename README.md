# SCALE Volsync Migration Catalog

This catalog is there for all Truecharts SCALE users to migrate their data onto S3-Storage.

 TrueNAS Migation App Catalog now Online

We're happy to announce we've launched a temporary TrueNAS SCALE App catalog, for those wanting to migrate and are currently missing VolSync to migrate their underlaying data.
The temporary migration catalog is available on the following URL:
https://github.com/truecharts/scale-volsync

Which can be copy-pasted to have it loaded into TrueNAS SCALE.

Please be aware of the following information:
We do not guarantee volsync works smoothly on SCALE, for most it does, for some it doesn't.
This would only work prior to upgrading to TrueNAS SCALE 24.10 "Electric Eel". If you've upgraded already, this will not work at all.
